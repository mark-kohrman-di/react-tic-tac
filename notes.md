APP.JS

The code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application.

index.js

You wonâ€™t be editing this file during the tutorial but it is the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser.

Fragments

- <></> wrappers to wrap multiple elements

Componentes must start with a capital letter e.g. <Square />

The componenet Square can be passed a value prop by inserting as an "argument" with curly braces
e.g. `function Square({ value })`

To pass `value` in the function you need curly braces
e.g. `return <button className="square">{value}</button>`
